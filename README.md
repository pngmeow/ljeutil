# ljeutil
A utility library for LJE re-adding many GLua functions, and optimising them, as well as adding additional functions which are useful.

# Best practices
- If you are rendering anything to the screen, use lje.util.rendertarget
- Use the utility functions provided by ljeutil instead of making your own implementations
- Do not modify the table returned by player.GetAll
- Disabling debug hooks, metatables, and saving/restoring the random state is not necessary for lua hooks, but should still be done in other places such as detours

# List of added hooks
```lua
--> format: {comment, name, ...args}
{
    --> called when lje.util.rendertarget is drawn to the screen
    "ljeutil/render"
}
```

# List of (re)added functions
```lua
{ --> draw
    SimpleText = function(text, font, x, y, color, xalign, yalign) end,
    SimpleTextOutlined = function(text, font, x, y, color, xalign, yalign, outlinewidth, outlinecolor) end,
    DrawText = function(text, font, x, y, color, xalign) end,
    GetFontHeight = function(font) end,
    NoTexture = function() end,
    RoundedBoxEx = function(radius, x, y, width, height, color, topleft, topright, bottomleft, bottomright) end,
    RoundedBox = function(radius, x, y, width, height, color) end,
    Text = function(textdata) end, --> do not use this unless it is absolutely necessary
    TextShadow = function(textdata, distance, alpha) end, --> do not use this unless it is absolutely necessary
    TexturedQuad = function(texturedata) end,
    WordBox = function(bordersize, x, y, text, font, boxcolor, textcolor, xalign, yalign) end
}

{ --> string
    ToTable = function(str) end,
    Explode = function(separator, str, withpattern) end,
    Split = function(str, separator) end,
    StartsWith = function(str, start) end,
    EndsWith = function(str, endstr) end,
    Replace = function(str, tofind, toreplace) end
}

{ --> math
    Round = function(number, idp) end,
    Clamp = function(number, low, high) end,
    Rand = function(low, high) end,
    IsNearlyEqual = function(a, b, tolerance) end,
    DistanceSqr = function(x1, y1, x2, y2) end,
    Distance = function(x1, y1, x2, y2) end,
    Dist = function(x1, y1, x2, y2) end
}

{ --> hook
    list = {}, --> event table
    disabled = false,

    pre = function(event, identifier, callback) end, --> adds an event to be run before normal gmod callbacks are ran for an event
                                                     --> if an identifier is not passed, one will be generated and returned
    post = function(event, identifier, callback) end, --> adds an event to be run after normal gmod callbacks are ran for an event
                                                     --> if an identifier is not passed, one will be generated and returned
    
    before = function(event, identifier, callback) end, --> alias for hook.pre
    after = function(event, identifier, callback) end, --> alias for hook.post

    --> these removal functions can be quite expensive with large hook tables as they use table.remove on the sequential table section
    removepre = function(event, identifier) end, --> removes an event that is run before normal gmod callbacks are ran for an event
    removepost = function(event, identifier) end, --> removes an event that is run after normal gmod callbacks are ran for an event

    removebefore = function(event, identifier) end, --> alias for hook.removepre
    removeafter = function(event, identifier) end, --> alias for hook.removepost

    callpre = function(event, ...) end, --> executes lje callbacks for the given pre hook event
    callpost = function(event, ...) end, --> executes lje callbacks for the given post hook event

    disable = function(disableljehooks) end, --> stops hooks from running - useful when re-rendering the scene, or using DrawModel - if disableljehooks is false (must be specified) then hooks registered with this library will still be called, otherwise if true or not specified, they will not be called
    enable = function() end --> re-enables hooks
}

{ --> cam
    Start2D = function() end,
    Start3D = function(pos, ang, fov, x, y, w, h, znear, zfar) end
}

{ --> _G
    Color = function(r, g, b, a) end
}

{ --> player
    GetAll = function() end, --> very fast re-implementation (all it does is return an upvalue) - do not modify the value returned by this
    GetCount = function() end --> very fast re-implementation (all it does is return an upvalue)
}

{ --> file
    Read = function(filename, path) end,
    Write = function(filename, contents) end,
    Append = function(filename, contents) end
}

{ --> lje.util
    rendertarget = GetRenderTargetEx(...), --> a render target which is safe to render to - this cannot be screengrabbed
    rt = GetRenderTargetEx(...), --> alias for lje.util.rendertarget - these are exactly the same
    iterate_players = function(callback) end, --> iterates over all players and calls the given callback with each player, excluding the local player
    random_string = function(length) end, --> generates a random string with either the given length, or 32 characters if not specified
    color_strict = function(r, g, b, a) end, --> very fast implementation of color - all arguments must be specified and must be numbers - values are still clamped
    is_player = function(entity) end --> should be used instead of ENTITY.IsPlayer or PLAYER.IsPlayer
}

{ --> lje.media
    --> this does not work right now since lje doesn't have a filesystem / data api yet
    load = function(path, callback) end, --> loads media (sounds, images, etc) from the given path in the lje filesystem - the callback is passed the virtual path of the media once it has been written to the data folder - the function returns whether or not it was successful, and the value returned by the callback
}
```

To use ljeutil, add it as a dependency in your info.toml script.
